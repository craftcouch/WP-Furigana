# WP Furigana

## Installation and usage:

1. Download and Extract the zip file and just drop the folder "wpfurigana" into the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.

2. Activate the Plugin "WP Furigana" on your "Plugins" page.

3. Go to a post or page edit view and you'll see a yellow button with the character "„Å∂".

4. To use WP Furigana, you highlight a piece of text, click the WP Furigana button and add your furigana.

5. Read about the known issues below.

## Known issues:

If you remove furigana in the visual editor, parts of the ruby tag will remain. It's very important not to leave empty ruby tags so the WordPress editor is cleaned up each time you add a new furigana. If you don't add any furigana after removing them in the visual editor, use the cleanup button introduced in the latest version of WP Furigana.

This plugin uses a custom CSS for Firefox, therefore, your text's line-height is very important. Never give your text's line-height a value lower than the default (1).

Furigana displays correctly in posts/pages in Firefox, but not in the editor itself. To be as kind as possible to bloggers with Firefox, at least the furigana in the editor is blue so it's easy to find.

The <rp> tag is not supported in the current version of WP Furigana.

## Possible issues:

Ruby is supported and displays correctly in Internet Explorer, however, the WordPress plugin itself has not been tested in the edit post/page view in Internet Explorer. So, the WP Furigana buttons may or may not play nice with you if you use Internet Explorer.

## Credits:

WP Furigana uses a modifed version of [Zoltan Hawryluk's ruby css](http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/10/29/cross-browser-html5-ruby-annotations-using-css/) which is based on George Chavchanidze's ruby css developed for Prince XML.
