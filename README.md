## Known issues:

If you remove furigana in the visual editor, parts of the ruby tag will remain. It's very important not to leave empty ruby tags so the WordPress editor is cleaned up each time you add a new furigana. If you don't add any furigana after removing them in the visual editor, use the cleanup button introduced in the latest version of WP Furigana.

This plugin uses a custom CSS for Firefox, therefore, your text's line-height is very important. Never give your text's line-height a value lower than the default (1).

Furigana displays correctly in posts/pages in Firefox, but not in the editor itself. To be as kind as possible to bloggers with Firefox, at least the furigana in the editor is blue so it's easy to find.

The <rp> tag is not supported in the current version of WP Furigana.

### Internet Explorer:

Ruby is supported and displays correctly in Internet Explorer, however, the WordPress plugin itself has not been tested in the edit post/page view in Internet Explorer. So, the WP Furigana buttons may or may not play nice with you if you use IE.
